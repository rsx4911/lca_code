# LCA Collaboration Server API Routes for testing
# Organized by priority (PO, P1, P2) for CI/CD pipeline execution
# Used for testing in the CI/CD pipeline
# Category: Fast - Quick operations that don't take much time to run.
# Category: Slow - Operations that typically take longer to complete/ complex processing items.

# UPDATED WITH UNIQUE PARENT KEYS UNDER EACH PRIORITY LEVEL SO TESTS CAN ACCESS THE CORRECT ENDPOINT.
